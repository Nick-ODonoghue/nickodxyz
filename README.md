This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
#
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website. I decided to recreate the site in React using Next.js and TailwindCSS for styling.

This portfolio site features a modular data structure, enabling easy customization for anyone. By separating the site's content into separate files, individuals can effortlessly update and personalize the data to reflect their own skills, projects, and experiences. This approach allows users to download the source code and quickly make the site their own.
